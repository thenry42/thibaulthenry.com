        <p>I am currently looking for an <span class="highlight">apprenticeship (Alternance)</span> starting as soon as possible.</p>
        
        <p>I have currently finished the <a href="https://42.fr/en/the-program/software-engineer-degree/" target="_blank" class="status-link">common-core of 42</a> and a professional experience is the next logical step in my academic life.</p>
        <p> It would be a great opportunity to learn and grow in a professional environment while still being in school. I intend on pursuing projects (both at school and outside) related to AI, game development and software engineering.</p>
